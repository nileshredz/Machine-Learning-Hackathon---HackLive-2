## Problem Statement:

* As YouTube becomes one of the most popular video-sharing platforms, YouTuber is developed as a new type of career in recent decades. YouTubers earn money through advertising revenue from YouTube videos, sponsorships from companies, merchandise sales, and donations from their fans. In order to maintain a stable income, the popularity of videos become the top priority for YouTubers. Meanwhile, some of our friends are YouTubers or channel owners in other video-sharing platforms. This raises our interest in predicting the performance of the video. If creators can have a preliminary prediction and understanding on their videos’ performance, they may adjust their video to gain the most attention from the public.
* You have been provided details on videos along with some features as well. Can you accurately predict the number of likes for each video using the set of input variables?
